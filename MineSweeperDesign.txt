SIZING:

The top bar floats above the other elements.
If the window size is less than 460 pixels tall, than the top bar is 46 pixels tall.
If the window size is more than 460 pixels tall, than the top bar is 10% of the screen resolution.
The text in the top bar is at an appropiate size for the top bar. 
The top bar includes the functions: New Game, Validate, Cheat and the actions: Explore and Flag.

The bottom half can be scrolled up so that all of the fields are below the top bar.

The fields shrink to fit all into the window until they are 46 pixels tall and wide.
If the mines have to shrink more be displayed at once, the minefield is expanded more than the screen.
